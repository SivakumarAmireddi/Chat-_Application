Creating a simple chat application using Python sockets involves building a client-server architecture, where the server listens for incoming connections and relays messages between clients. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement a basic two-user chat app using Python's built-in socket library.


How It Works:
Server:
Listens for two client connections.
Once both clients are connected, the server forwards messages between them using the forward_messages function.
Client:
Connects to the server.
Runs two threads: one for receiving messages from the other user and one for sending messages.


Running the Chat Application:
Start the server:

Run the server.py script on your machine. It will start listening for client connections.
Start two clients:

Run the client.py script twice (from two terminals or two machines), both of which will connect to the server.
Each client will be able to send messages that the other client will receive in real time.


This simple chat application uses Python sockets to set up communication between two users over a network. You can further extend this application by adding features like more clients, file sharing, or message encryption.
